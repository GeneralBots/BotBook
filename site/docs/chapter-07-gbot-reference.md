## Config in Detail

### Admin Notify E-mail
The "Admin Notify E-mail" setting specifies the email addresses that will receive notifications regarding the botâ€™s activities and administrative updates. This feature ensures that administrators are promptly informed about any critical events or issues related to the bot's operation, allowing them to take necessary actions swiftly.

### Answer Mode

In a bot factory configuration, the integration of a Language Learning Model (LLM) is pivotal in enhancing the functionality and efficiency of the bots. The LLM can be employed in various modes depending on the requirements of the bot system. These modes include "direct," "document," "document-ref," "sql," and "tool," each offering a unique method of interaction and data handling. For instance, in the "direct" mode, the LLM is used to generate responses or actions based on real-time user input, providing immediate and contextually relevant replies. This approach is particularly useful for creating conversational agents that can handle a wide range of user queries effectively.
In the "document" mode, the LLM processes and generates responses based on pre-existing documents or content. This mode is ideal for scenarios where the bot needs to reference detailed information or provide insights derived from specific documents. The LLM analyzes the content of the documents to deliver accurate and contextually appropriate information, thereby enhancing the bot's ability to offer valuable and precise responses. This approach is particularly beneficial for applications that require in-depth knowledge or detailed guidance based on existing resources.
The "document-ref" mode builds on the document-based approach by allowing the LLM to reference and extract information from multiple documents to generate comprehensive responses. This mode is advantageous when the bot needs to synthesize information from various sources to provide well-rounded answers or perform complex tasks. In contrast, the "sql" mode leverages structured query language to interact with databases, enabling the LLM to retrieve and manipulate data based on specific queries. Lastly, the "tool" mode integrates the LLM with external tools or services, allowing the bot to extend its functionality by interacting with other applications or systems. Each mode offers a distinct advantage, allowing the bot factory to tailor its approach based on the specific needs and objectives of the bot system.
