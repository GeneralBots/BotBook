##fork concept


A fork or branch it happens when a developer (or a group of developers) starts an independent project based on the code of an existing project, that is, when a software is developed based on another, already existing, without the discontinuity of the latter.

The term is particularly used in free or open source software, when a division occurs because of different goals or personality fights. Some see bifurcations as a weakness in free software, but others believe that they demonstrate the adaptability of the model.
